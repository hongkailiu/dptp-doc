# Brno 2019

[gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-xBKlIeW1kPV6UK78uXkpPIsBrTe4e52lLAF7OXO-s/edit)

Things I wanna know:

* prow architecture: 
    * components: the communication between prow components; the communication to external components, eg, github/jenkins
    * plugins

* ci-operator
    * make sure [my understanding](../architecture.md#openshift-ci) of the flow of prow and ci-operator is correct.
    * which component uses our prowjob configurations? like creating prowjob crd (eg, running ci-operator) when PR is created.

* my focus on this year
    * monitoring stack
    * anything else?

* features that benefit us

* others
    * [`resp.Header.Set("X-Conditional-Request", etag)`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/af1a26bf30f5f3776dba3b171899f400d3fe22ad/ghproxy/ghcache/ghcache.go#L190)?
