# Brno 2019

Things I wanna know:

* prow architecture: 
    * which prow components read the job configs and create prowJobs? Hook (and all other prow's core components); which prow component(s) act(s) on `cr` of `prowJob`s? Plank. See [life_of_a_prow_job](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/life_of_a_prow_job.md).
    * Do we deploy [`Gubernator`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/gubernator) in our cluser (mentioned at [life_of_a_prow_job.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/life_of_a_prow_job.md))? No? (did not see its pod). This is from deck UI: _The old job viewer, Gubernator, has been deprecated in favour of this page, Spyglass._ which componenent generates and stores the test logs, eg, [release-openshift-origin-installer-e2e-aws-upgrade/6253](https://prow.svc.ci.openshift.org/view/gcs/origin-ci-test/logs/release-openshift-origin-installer-e2e-aws-upgrade/6253)? By pod-utilities?
    Steve: No pod because it is deployed on google App platform.
    Both `deck` and `Gubernator` are the frontend from the data
    stored on google-storage by pod-uitilities: init-uploader and side-car.

* ci-operator: clarified with the new [architecture.k8s.diagram](../architecture.md)
    * make sure [my understanding](../architecture.md#openshift-ci) of the flow of prow and ci-operator is correct.
    * upstream has no ci-operator. Why do we need it? Our test need a live cluster from another cloude-provider? Build/promote images?

* ci-cluster:
    * autoscaler? Qs on [set up](../devops.md#ci-cluster) on mngment of node pool
    Steve: one of Clayton's magics; Petr: some clue from
    ```
    $ oc get deployment cluster-autoscaler -n kube-system
    NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    cluster-autoscaler   1         1         1            1           327d

    ```

* my focus on this year
    * monitoring stack
    * e2e tests for ci-operator: To ci-op, QA. To me, getting familiar to templates.
    * anything else? features that benefit us

* others
    * [`resp.Header.Set("X-Conditional-Request", etag)`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/af1a26bf30f5f3776dba3b171899f400d3fe22ad/ghproxy/ghcache/ghcache.go#L190)?
