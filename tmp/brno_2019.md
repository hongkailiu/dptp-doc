# Brno 2019

[gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-xBKlIeW1kPV6UK78uXkpPIsBrTe4e52lLAF7OXO-s/edit)

Things I wanna know:

* prow architecture: 
    * which prow components read the job configs and create prowJobs? Hook; which prow component(s) act(s) on `cr` of `prowJob`s? Plank. See [life_of_a_prow_job](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/life_of_a_prow_job.md).
    * Do we deploy [`Gubernator`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/gubernator) in our cluser? Yes, but depredated already. This is from deck UI: _The old job viewer, Gubernator, has been deprecated in favour of this page, Spyglass._ which componenent generates and stores the test logs, eg, [release-openshift-origin-installer-e2e-aws-upgrade/6253](https://prow.svc.ci.openshift.org/view/gcs/origin-ci-test/logs/release-openshift-origin-installer-e2e-aws-upgrade/6253)?

* ci-operator
    * make sure [my understanding](../architecture.md#openshift-ci) of the flow of prow and ci-operator is correct.
    * upstream has no ci-operator. Why do we need it? Our test need a live cluster from another cloude-provider?

* ci-cluster:
    * autoscaler? Qs on [set up](../devops.md#ci-cluster) on mngment of node pool

* my focus on this year
    * monitoring stack
    * anything else?

* features that benefit us

* others
    * [`resp.Header.Set("X-Conditional-Request", etag)`](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/af1a26bf30f5f3776dba3b171899f400d3fe22ad/ghproxy/ghcache/ghcache.go#L190)?
