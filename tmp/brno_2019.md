Thinks I wanna know:

* prow architecture: 
    * components: the communication between prow components; the communication to external components, eg, github/jenkins
    * plugins

* ci-operator
    * make sure [my understanding](../architecture.md#) of the flow of prow and ci-operator is correct.
    * which component uses our prowjob configurations? Plank?

* parts I should focus on this year

* features that benefits us
