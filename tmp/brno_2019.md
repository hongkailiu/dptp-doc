[gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-xBKlIeW1kPV6UK78uXkpPIsBrTe4e52lLAF7OXO-s/edit)

Things I wanna know:

* prow architecture: 
    * components: the communication between prow components; the communication to external components, eg, github/jenkins
    * plugins

* ci-operator
    * make sure [my understanding](../architecture.md#) of the flow of prow and ci-operator is correct.
    * which component uses our prowjob configurations? Plank?

* my focus on this year
    * monitoring stack
    * anything else?

* features that benefit us
